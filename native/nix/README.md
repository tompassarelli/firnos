# Clause modules

`nixos-config:native/nix/btop.clause` and `nixos-config:native/nix/jq.clause`
are the original small comparison using one shared declaration source,
`nixos-config:native/nix/nixpkgs.clause`. Their generated enable options and
conditional package lists are compared with the pre-migration modules at
`d5734ff6` using the
repository's locked nixpkgs input.
The same checked module form also supplies fifteen package modules, including
ripgrep, fd, tree, wget, unzip, and curl.

Build `clause-workbench` from the exact revision in
`nixos-config:config/clause-revision`, read its `authoring-card`, and pass that
executable to `nixos-config:native/nix/compare.test.sh`. The check opens all five
sources through reading, elaboration, lowering, and session opening, then
compiles them and evaluates default, disabled, and enabled configurations. It
compares enablement, option types, defaults, descriptions, package names, and
package output paths. Generated modules remain under
`nixos-config:.firn-build/nix-comparison/`.

`nixos-config:modules/<name>/tags.clause` explicitly selects
`nixos-config:native/nix/<name>.clause`, exporting `<name>-module`, as the
module source. The metadata file owns automatic and opt-in tag membership, for example:

```clause
import "../../native/module_metadata.clause"

export metadata(): ModuleMetadata
  module-metadata(["cli-tools"], [])
```

The resolver compiles each source once and calls its checked metadata export.
The shared record requires `tags` and `optIn`, both `Sequence<Text>`; malformed
foreign results reject. btop and jq retain automatic `cli-tools` membership.
Kitty uses `module-metadata([], ["terminal"])`; Ladybird opts into `browsers`.
Enabling either tag alone excludes its opt-in module. A competing
`nixos-config:modules/<name>/default.bnix` or a missing Clause source is an error. Modules without this metadata file continue to use
their existing Beagle source. Shared declaration files are not module entries.

Run `firn-runtime-update` after changing `nixos-config:config/clause-revision`.
It builds that exact revision from `~/code/clause/main` (or the explicitly
selected `FIRN_CLAUSE_REPO`) into the out-of-store user runtime and binds it
automatically for tag, inventory, and build commands. The launchers reject
a checkout whose declared revision differs from the installed runtime.
No `FIRN_CLAUSE_WORKBENCH` setting is needed; an explicit setting must identify
the same produced executable. The compiler's shared libraries are retained
by user runtime GC roots without adding the compiler to the system closure.
The build driver
discovers the selected source, compiles it to the existing
`nixos-config:modules/<name>/default.nix`, and retains the flake's ordinary
directory discovery. `firn repo diff native/nix` checks the generated outputs.
Both source forms use the same tag resolver. These commands do not activate a
system configuration.

With `BEAGLE_PATH` set to the repository's Beagle compiler, run
`nixos-config:native/nix/resolver.test.sh` with the pinned workbench executable
as its argument. It builds the resolver/build graph, discovers and compiles the
five actual sources in a fixture, checks automatic and opt-in selection and
generated outputs,
evaluates them against the original modules, and rejects conflicting or missing
source ownership and wrongly typed metadata exports.
