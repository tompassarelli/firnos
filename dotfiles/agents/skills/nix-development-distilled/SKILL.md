# Nix project development

Use the project's existing manifests, flake, lock file, build commands, and
supported platforms as authority. Route NixOS machine configuration to
`firn-distilled`; a project package or shell grants no system-closure access.

Follow the project's typed source declaration and immutable compiler pin for
new Tom-owned Nix semantics. Existing plain Nix is not automatically a migration
task. Keep credentials,
unrequested caches, and global settings out of the change.

Declare only consumed outputs: a development shell, package, app, check, or
exported module. Reuse native toolchain manifests and pin flake inputs. Include
the compiler, package manager, linker, headers, and tools required by the real
build; keep shell hooks minimal and deterministic.

Generate and validate source, then exercise the requested output. Git flakes
ignore untracked files: use an explicit path URL or stage named new files.
Run the nearest actual project command inside the declared environment.
Do not turn ad-hoc PATH assembly or a global toolchain installation into the
normal workflow.

Distinguish evaluation, input, source-filtering, lock, and project-code failures.
Report the working output and untested platform limits.

Bad: rewriting a working `flake.nix` into Beagle/Nix source because the
tooling now supports it, with no new semantics being added in that file.
Good: convert only the file you are already changing for new Tom-owned
semantic work; existing working plain Nix elsewhere is not a migration task
just because it is now possible.
