# Machine capacity

Use the shared helper, not worker slots or load average, to admit heavy work:

```bash
capacity_skill=$(dirname "$(agents path machine-capacity-distilled)")
capacity="$capacity_skill/scripts/machine-capacity.mjs"
bun "$capacity" run --class heavy --owner "codex:/root/task" \
  --timeout-seconds 900 -- COMMAND ARG...
```

Choose the smallest sufficient class: `moderate` (2 CPUs/2 GiB), `heavy`
(6 CPUs/8 GiB), or `exclusive` (bounded heavy budget with no peer heavy lease).
Set an honest hard runtime bound including legitimate setup and downloads;
the example is not a universal timeout.

The wrapper admits atomically and contains every descendant in one user
cgroup. All helper jobs share a CPU limit of 75% of the host; per-job CPU
allowances are ceilings, not measured use or additive reservations. Exclusive
runs wait for all peer local jobs and block new local jobs until release.
Do not detach work outside the scope. One owner retains the terminal
`RELEASED` result and cleans up the exact scope.

`RUN`/`RESERVED` continues; `DEFER` queues heavy work while useful light work
continues. Retry after a known release or at least 30 seconds, never busy-poll.
`RECLAIMED` concerns expired helper-owned leases, not permission to kill peers.
Memory PSI is diagnostic: local cgroup throttling can raise it despite ample
host headroom. Admission uses available memory, lease budgets, and CPU pressure.

Before a parallel worker expected to consume local compute, reserve its
`agent` lease (768 MiB, no local CPU reservation); renew before expiry and
release at settlement. Its local commands still require their own `run` scope.
Only `agent` permits persistent reservation. Exact commands and headroom
rules: [nixos-config:capacity leases and limits](references/leases-and-limits.md).

Never kill a peer process. Only its owner or accountable parent may stop the
identified tree. Pressure changes admission, not correctness requirements.
